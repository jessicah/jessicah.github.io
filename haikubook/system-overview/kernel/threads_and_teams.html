<h1>Threads and Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#threads-and-teams" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>A thread is a synchronous process that executes a series of program instructions. A team is a group
of threads that make up a single program or application.</p>
<p>Every application has at least one thread: When you launch an application, an initial thread—the
main thread—is automatically created (or spawned) and told to run. The main thread executes the
ubiquitous <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main()</span></code> function, winds through the functions that are called from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main()</span></code>, and is
automatically deleted (or killed) when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main()</span></code> exits.</p>
<p>Haiku is multithreaded: from the main thread you can spawn and run additional threads; from each of
these threads you can spawn and run more threads, and so on. All the threads in all applications run
concurrently and asynchronously with each other.</p>
<p>Threads are independant of each other. Most notably, a given thread doesn’t own the other threads it
has spawned. For example, if thread A spawns thread B, and thread A dies (for whatever reason),
thread B will continue to run. (But before you get carried away with the idea of leap-frogging
threads, you should take note of the caveat in “Death and the Main Thread”.)</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Threads and the POSIX <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code> function are not compatible.
You can’t mix calls to <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code> (the function that creates a new thread) and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code> in the same application: If you call <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code> and then try to call
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code>, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code> call will fail.</p>
</div>
<p>Although threads are independent, they do fall into groups called teams. A team consists of a main
thread and all other threads that “descend” from it (that are spawned by the main thread directly,
or by any thread that was spawned by the main thread, and so on). Viewed from a higher level, a team
is the group of threads that are created by a single application. You can’t “transfer” threads from
one team to another. The team is set when the thread is spawned; it remains the same throughout the
thread’s life.</p>
<p>All the threads in a particular team share the same address space: Global variables that are
declared by one thread will be visible to all other threads in that team.</p>

<h2>Spawning a Thread<a class="headerlink" href="#spawning-a-thread" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You spawn a thread by calling the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code> function. The function assigns and
returns a system-wide <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_id</span></code> number that you use to identify the new thread in subsequent
function calls. Valid <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_id</span></code> numbers are positive integers; you can check the success of a
spawn thus:</p>

<p>The arguments to <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>, which are examined throughout this description, supply
information such as what the thread is supposed to do, the urgency of its operation, and so on.</p>
<section id="threads-and-app-images">
<h3>Threads and App Images<a class="headerlink" href="#threads-and-app-images" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A conceptual neighbor of spawning a thread is the act of loading an executable (or loading an app
image). This is performed by calling the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_image()</span></code> function. Loading an image causes
a separate program, identified as a file, to be launched by the system. For more information on the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_image()</span></code> function, see “Images”.</p>

<h2>Telling a Thread to Run<a class="headerlink" href="#telling-a-thread-to-run" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Spawning a thread isn’t enough to make it run. To tell a thread to start running, you must pass its
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_id</span></code> to either the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resume_thread()</span></code> or <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait_for_thread()</span></code> functions:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Function</p></th>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resume_thread()</span></code></p></td>
<td><p>Starts the new thread running and immediately returns. The new thread runs concurrently and
asychronously with the thread in which <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resume_thread()</span></code> was called.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait_for_thread()</span></code></p></td>
<td><p>Starts the thread running but doesn’t return until the thread has finished. (You can also call
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait_for_thread()</span></code> on a thread that’s already running.)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Of these two functions, <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resume_thread()</span></code> is the more common means for starting a thread
that was created through <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>. <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait_for_thread()</span></code> is typically used
to start the thread that was created through <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_image()</span></code>.</p>

<section id="the-thread-function">
<h2>The Thread Function<a class="headerlink" href="#the-thread-function" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you call <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>, you must identify the new thread’s thread function. This
is a global C function (or a static C++ member function) that the new thread will execute when it’s
told to run. The thread function, defined as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_func</span></code>, takes a single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(void*)</span></code> argument and
returns an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int32</span></code> error code. When the thread function exits, the thread is automatically killed.</p>
<p>You pass a thread function as the first argument to <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>. For example, here we
spawn a thread that uses a function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lister()</span></code> as its thread function. The last argument to
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code> is forwarded to the thread function:</p>

</section>
<section id="thread-names">
<h2>Thread Names<a class="headerlink" href="#thread-names" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A thread can be given a name which you assign through the second argument to
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>. The name can be 32 characters long (as represented by the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-enum docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_OS_NAME_LENGTH</span></code> constant) and needn’t be unique—more than one thread can have the
same name.</p>
<p>You can look for a thread based on its name by passing the name to the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">find_thread()</span></code>
function; the function returns the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_id</span></code> of the so-named thread. If two or more threads bear
the same name, the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">find_thread()</span></code> function returns the first of these threads that it
finds.</p>
<p>You can retrieve the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_id</span></code> of the calling thread by passing <code class="xref cpp cpp-enum docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NULL</span></code> to
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">find_thread()</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-cpp notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">thread_id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">this_thread</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">find_thread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To retrieve a thread’s name, you must look in the thread’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_info</span></code> structure. This structure
is described in the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_thread_info()</span></code> function description.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with a thread’s name? Use the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rename_thread()</span></code> function to change it. Fool
your friends.</p>

<section id="thread-priorities">
<h2>Thread Priorities<a class="headerlink" href="#thread-priorities" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a multi-threaded environment, the CPUs must divide their attention between the candidate threads,
executing a few instructions from this thread, then a few from that thread, and so on. But the
division of attention isn’t always equal. You can assign a higher or lower priority to a thread and
so declare it to be more or less important than other threads.</p>
<p>You assign a thread’s priority (an integer) as the third argument to <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>.
There are two categories of priorities: “time-sharing” and “real-time”.</p>
<dl class="simple myst">
<dt>Time-sharing (values from 1 to 99).</dt><dd><p>A time-sharing thread is executed only if there are no real-time threads in the ready queue. In
the absence of real-time threads, a time-sharing thread is elected to run once every “scheduler
quantum” (currently, every three milliseconds). The higher the time-sharing thread’s priority value,
the greater the chance that it will be the next thread to run.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Real-time (100 and greater).</dt><dd><p>A real-time thread is executed as soon as it’s ready. If more than one real-time thread is ready
at the same time, the thread with the highest priority is executed first. The thread is allowed to
run without being preempted (except by a real-time thread with a higher priority) until it blocks,
snoozes, is suspended, or otherwise gives up its plea for attention.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Kernel Kit defines seven priority constants (see “Thread Priority Values” for the list).
ALthough you can use other, “in-between” value as the priority argument to
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spawn_thread()</span></code>, it’s suggested that you stick with these.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can call the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suggest_thread_priority()</span></code> function to let the Kernel Kit
determine a good priority for your thread. This function takes information about the thread’s
scheduling and CPU needs, and returns a reasonable priority value to use when spawning the thread.</p>

<section id="synchronizing-threads">
<h2>Synchronizing Threads<a class="headerlink" href="#synchronizing-threads" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are times when you may want a particular thread to pause at a designated point until some
other (known) thread finishes some task. Here are three ways to effect this sort of synchronization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The most general means for synchronizing threads is to use a semaphore. The semaphore mechanism is
described in great detail in “Semaphores”.</p></li>
<li><p>Synchronization is sometimes a side-effect of sending data between threads. This is explained in
“Passing Data to a Thread”, and in “Ports”.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you can tell a thread to wait for some other thread to die by calling
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait_for_thread()</span></code>, as described earlier.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="controlling-a-thread">
<h2>Controlling a Thread<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-a-thread" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are four ways to control a thread while it’s running:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>You can put the calling thread to sleep for some number of microseconds through the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">snooze()</span></code> and <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">snooze_until()</span></code> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can suspend the execution of any thread through the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suspend_thread()</span></code> function.
The thread remains suspended until you “unsuspend” it through a call to
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resume_thread()</span></code> or <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait_for_thread()</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can send a POSIX “signal” to a thread through the <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send_signal()</span></code> function. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SIGCONT</span></code> signal tries to unblock a blocked or sleeping thread without killing it; all other
signals kill the thread. To override this behavior, you can install your own signal handlers.</p></li>
<li><p>You can kill the calling thread through <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exit_thread()</span></code>, or kill some other thread
through <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kill-thread()</span></code>. Feeling itchy? Try killing an entire team of threads: the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kill_team()</span></code> function is more than a system call. It’s therapy.</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="death-and-the-main-thread">
<h3>Death and the Main Thread<a class="headerlink" href="#death-and-the-main-thread" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the control that’s imposed upon a particular thread isn’t visited upon the
“children” that have been spawned from that thread. However, the death of an application’s main
thread can affect other threads:</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>When a main thread dies, the game is pretty much over. The main thread takes the team’s heap, it’s
statically allocated objects, and other team-wide resources—such as access to standard IO—with
it. This may seriously cripple any threads that linger beyond the death of the main thread.</p>
</div>
<p>It’s possible to create an application in which the main thread sets up one or more other threads,
gets them running, and then dies. But such applications should be rare. In general, you should try
to keep your main thread around until all other threads in the team are dead.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="passing-data-to-a-thread">
<h2>Passing Data to a Thread<a class="headerlink" href="#passing-data-to-a-thread" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every thread has a message cache. You can write to a thread’s message cache through the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send_data()</span></code> function. The thread can pick up your message (a combination of an integer
and a buffer) through <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">receive_data()</span></code>. The cache is only one message deep; if there’s a
message already in the cache, <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send_data()</span></code> will block. Conversely, if there’s no meesage
in the cache, <code class="xref cpp cpp-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recevie_data()</span></code> will also block.</p>
<p>You can pass data to a thread through a port. Arbitrarily deep, ports are more flexible than the
message cache. See “Ports” for details.</p>
