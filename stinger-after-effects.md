# Creating Track Matte Stinger in After Effects

Start with a canvas twice the width of your
target resolution. The left hand side should
be transparent with any animation on top.
The right side should ideally start off as
fully black (source image), and end fully
white (destination image), with whatever
transition animation from black to white.

For exporting, you must use QuickTime and
RGB+alpha, which will preserve the
transparency, and will work in OBS
without any extra work.
